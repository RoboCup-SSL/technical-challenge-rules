== Competition Procedure

There are multiple stages with increasing difficulty.
Participants will have 3 trials for each stage.
All trials will be considered for the overall score.

Each trial will be attempted by all participants, one after another.
The starting configuration of the trial will be similar for each team to achieve same conditions for all participants.

If a participant can not attempt a trial for what ever reasons, no points are awarded for this trial.
Other trials are not effected.

The robots may move anywhere on the field within the walls.
Similarly, the ball may move anywhere on the field throughout the time.
Any defined positions will always be inside the field boundaries.

=== Field setup

Challenges will be executed on a Division B sized field as described in the main SSL rules.

Because the vision patterns are not required, markings may be added to the field before a run to help the human judges verify that the robots are reaching the desired positions and orientations.
Participants should not expect a perfect field with no additional markings.
However, attempts will be made to keep the marks minimal and small to not interfere with on-board vision solutions.
Additionally, participants should expect visual aspects of the field to vary slightly, including the exact color of the carpet and walls, the width of line markings, etc.

=== Referee commands

Each trial will start with a *HALT* command.
Just before the start, a *STOP* command will be given to allow participants to prepare.
When a *FORCE START* command is sent, the timer is started and robots may move.
The trial will be stopped with a *HALT* command after successful challenge completion or after the time ran out

=== Scoring

Each stage may define a set of criteria which give positive or negative points.
Points will also be given if the overall objective was not achieved.
The duration of a trial is used as a tie-breaker (faster is better).

=== Stage 1: Grab a Stationary Ball

This stage is designed to be the easiest and to demonstrate basic sensing and control capabilities.
The robot will need to detect a ball on the field, navigate to it, and place it on its dribbler.

==== Procedure

- The supervisor defines random starting positions for robot and ball, as well as a random orientation for the robot.
- Robot and ball are moved to their starting positions
- The trial is started
- The trial is stopped after one minute or if the robot did not move for 10 seconds after moving at least once

==== Scoring

- Touching the ball with any part of the robot -- +1
- Touching the ball with the dribbler -- +1
- Robot stopped with the ball touching the dribbler at the end of the run-- +1

=== Stage 2: Scoring on an Empty Goal

This stage requires robots to localize themselves as well as the ball on the playing field, move to the ball and score a goal.

==== Procedure

- The supervisor defines a random robot starting position and orientation
- The supervisor defines a random ball starting position
- Robot and ball are moved to their starting positions
- The trial is started
- The trial is stopped after one minute or if the robot scored a goal

==== Additional Rules

- Either of the two goals may be used for scoring

==== Scoring

- Touching the ball with any part of the robot -- +1
- Touching the ball with the dribbler -- +1
- Ball entered any defense zone -- +1
- Ball entered any goal -- +1
- Robot entered any defense zone -- -1

=== Stage 3: Moving to Specific Coordinates

This stage is designed to demonstrate localization capabilities without the use of the global vision system.
No ball will be used for this stage.

==== Procedure

- The supervisor defines a random target position, random robot orientation and a random start position seed.
- Participants may enter the staring position seed and the target position into their robot configuration
- The supervisor defines a random robot starting orientation
- The supervisor defines a random robot starting position that is within 0.5 m distance to the position seed
- the Robot is moved to its starting positions and orientation
- The trial is started
- The trial is stopped after one minute or if the robot did not move for 10 seconds after moving at least once

==== Scoring

The score is equal to the negative straight line distance between the robot's final position and the destination position.
(In other words, closer is better)

=== Stage 4: Scoring an Indirect Goal (without Obstacles)

The objective of this stage is to score an indirect goal using two robots.
Robots are required to recognize other robots, receive a ball, coordinate between each other and finally to score a goal.

==== Procedure

- The supervisor defines a random ball starting position seed in the positive field half
- Robot 1 is placed at (0.5 m, 1.5 m, 0°)
- Robot 2 is placed at (0.5 m, 1.5 m, 0°)
- The ball is placed at a random starting position within 0.5 m distance of the position seed.

==== Scoring

- Touching the ball with any part of the passing robot -- +1
- Touching the ball with the passing robot dribbler -- +1
- Pass hits receiver robot -- +1
- Pass hits the receiver robot dribbler -- +1
 - Ball entered a defense zone -- +1
- Ball entered goal -- +1
- Robot entered a defense zone -- -1
