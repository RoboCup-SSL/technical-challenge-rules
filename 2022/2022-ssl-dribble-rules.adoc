== Goals of the Technical Challenge

Last year we hosted hardware challenges as a way to promote the development of hardware
even though there would be no physical competition. However, we noticed that many teams had
trouble performing the dribbling challenge. Because of that, we decided to keep it as a
technical challenge this year, giving teams more opportunity to work on this. 

== Procedure

There are six gates defined in this challenge. A gate is the line between two robots. For a robot to successfully pass a gate, it must cross this line.

The gates are:

* Gate A - between robot 0 and 1
* Gate B - between robot 1 and 2
* Gate C - between robot 2 and 3
* Gate D - between robot 3 and 0
* Gate E - between robot 0 and 4
* Gate F - between robot 5 and 6

The ball starts inside the bots 0-1-2-3 shape, the (blue) robot at the corner.

The robot should then get the ball and do the following procedure:

* Pass with the ball gate A twice
* Pass with the ball gate B twice
* Pass with the ball gate C twice
* Pass with the ball gate D once
* Pass with the ball gate E once
* Pass with the ball gate F once

The robot should finalize the challenge placing the ball around one meter away from robot 6.

See Appendix A for the visualization of the field before the start of the challenge. 


== Evaluation

Every team will have 5 minutes to complete the challenge. 

One point will be awarded for each gate successfully passed. In case of a tie, the team with the least
amount of time wins. 

The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.
